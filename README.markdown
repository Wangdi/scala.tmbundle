I wasn't happy with the official [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) bundle so I started my own bundle. It has since been hugely improved by [Paul Phillips](http://github.com/paulp) and is now vastly better than the original one. It still needs some work but it is very usable (I use it for all my Scala development) 

It might work best if used in conjunction with [the theme Paul Phillips use](http://github.com/paulp/scala.tmtheme) alongside it:

    git clone git://github.com/mads379/scala.tmbundle.git
    git clone git://github.com/paulp/scala.tmtheme.git
    open scala.tmbundle
    open scala.tmtheme/Vibrant\ Scala.tmTheme

Improvements welcome.
