This began as a fork of [this bundle](git://github.com/mads379/scala.tmbundle.git) but it has left the nest.  Thanks to mads379 for getting the ball rolling.

This is a bundle for scala programming maintained by a guy who does nothing but write scala all day.  It's not done yet but it's more pleasant than the other bundles I've come across.  I'll keep working on it.

It might work best if used in conjunction with the theme I use alongside it:

    git clone git://github.com/mads379/scala.tmbundle.git
    git clone git://github.com/paulp/scala.tmtheme.git
    open scala.tmbundle
    open scala.tmtheme/Vibrant\ Scala.tmTheme

Improvements welcome.
