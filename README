Scala-TextMate-Bundle

What does it do

I started this bundle because I wasn't happy with the syntax definitions in the bundle that comes with Scala. 

The bundle new syntax definitions means better hightlighting and that the right things show up in the Symbols List. 

Installation guide

To get started simply run

git clone git://github.com/mads379/scala.tmbundle.git
open scala.tmbundle
